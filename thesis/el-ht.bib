abstract = {In this paper an attempt is made to explore the logical foundations of computer programming by use of techniques which were first applied in the study of geometry and have later been extended to other branches of mathematics. This involves the elucidation of sets of axioms and rules of inference which can be used in proofs of the properties of computer programs. Examples are given of such axioms and rules, and a formal proof of a simple theorem is displayed. Finally, it is argued that important advantage, both theoretical and practical, may follow from a pursuance of these topics.},

Both partial and total correctness are treated. In particular a proof system for total correctness of recursive procedures in the presence of unbounded nondeterminism is presented. All systems are formalized and shown to be sound and complete in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL.",
