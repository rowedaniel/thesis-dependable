\begin{document}
% First, we go into "front matter" mode.
% Among other things, this gives us Roman page numbers.
\frontmatter

% We tell LaTeX to make a title page, sections for acknowledgments, the abstract, and the table of contents (important!). 

\maketitle

\chapter{Acknowledgments}
`This page is for making acknowledgements that have a direct bearing on the HT and is not for indulging in routine gestures of politeness or sentimental attitudinising. In all things, the candidate should be guided by good taste and good sense' \pgcitep{ell-ht-format}{2}. % Note also the command for citing a source and a page number. 

\begin{abstract}
  Be sure to keep it under 300 words \citep{ell-ht-format}.
\end{abstract}

\tableofcontents

% Include the list of figures and list of tables only if you actually have figures and tables! (The * after each indicates that it should not be included in the table of contents.)
%\listoffigures*
%\listoftables*

% Next, we go into "main matter" mode.
% This resets the page numbers and uses Arabic numerals.

\chapter{Introduction}

This is a chapter.

\section{Overview}

You can embed sections and subsections.

\subsection{Research Question}

Is `\LaTeX' pronounced \phonet{let\super hEk\super h} or \phonet{lat\super hEk\super h}?


\section{Trees and Glosses}

Packages have documentation that explain (among other things) how to implement them. These are brief implementation examples for \texttt{expex} and \texttt{tikz-qtree}. 

Glossed examples data can be presented like in (\ref{ex:missile}) below.

\ex\label{ex:missile}
\begingl
\gla Missile cannot anyhow tzua one. //
\glb Missile cannot carelessly fire \textsc{attr} //
\glft `Missiles should not be carelessly fired.' //
\endgl
\xe

A syntax tree can be presented and labelled as a figure, as with Figure \ref{fig:ticket-topic} below. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\caption{Deriving `Ticket you got?' through topicalisation}
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.75]
\Tree [.S$'$ \node(x){\qroof{ticket}.NP }; [.S $\emptyset$ [.VP {\qroof{you}.NP } [.V$'$ [.V got ] \node(y){t}; ] ] ] ]
\draw[semithick, <-] (x.south)..controls +(south:5) and +(south:3)..(y.south);
\end{tikzpicture}
\label{fig:ticket-topic}
\end{figure}


% If you want to include appendices, just use the \appendix command and then make chapters as normal
\appendix
\chapter{Your first appendix}
